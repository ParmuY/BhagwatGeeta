# BhagwatGeeta
Hi,
This was my first android project. I made this project in second year of my college days. The journey of building this project was very nice.

In this project, I have developed an application which have translations of all Bhagvad Gita verses (700 verses) and also audio resources
of pronunciation (the audio resources are fetched from the firebase).

In this project, various features of android and other techologies are implemented:
-> Fragments
-> Google Firebase
-> Admob
-> Notification system using firebase
->The image of verses are generated using bitmap and can be shared with others.
